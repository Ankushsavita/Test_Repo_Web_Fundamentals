//Question 2. What is the difference between null , undefined and not defined.

//null:-

let c = null;
console.log(c);    //Null is a reserved keyword in javascript.
                   //we can re-assign some values here.
                   //Null represents an empty value.

//undefined:- 

let i;
console.log(i);    // Un-defined: when no value is Assigned to a variable, the value is called "un-defined".

//not defined:- 

console.log(k);   //Not-defined: when the variable is not present in your code, the value is called "not-defined".
